# ALAND's Broken Moon

This resource pack turns the moon into something more than a dusty rock drifting in space. Allow me to recount its tale through the words of a long-lost poet, who saw what others could not.

üìú Lore

That thing is no ordinary moon. It is a shell -- a cocoon. An egg that holds a shadowy blight -- a being older than the stars at night. At first it seemed so harmless... until it cracked. A sight so dark and charmless... my sanity, attacked.

I watched it hatch, watched that THING grow -- a cosmic horror none could overthrow. And then... it shattered, leaving a vessel behind. Another egg to wake, another fate entwined. And I watch... as the cycle begins anew -- an unstoppable force, one I cannot subdue.

Birth. Growth. Death. Rebirth. I... I need some rest.

-The Lunatic
